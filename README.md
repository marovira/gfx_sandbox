## What is this?

This is a space for me to test out and develop new ideas related to graphics. The general
structure of the repo is as follows:

* `resting_grounds`: contains shelved ideas that I may use later on. It's mostly there so
  I don't forget about them down the line.
* `gallery`: main folder containing all the sand-boxed projects. Code may be repeated
  across different projects as needed.

**NOTE:** the code contained in this repo should be considered highly experimental and
does not necessarily reflect best practices. In addition, the code is only tested on
Windows, so there are no guarantees that it will compile in Linux.

## Gallery
